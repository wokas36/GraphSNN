README for dataset BZR


=== Usage ===

This folder contains the following comma separated text files 
(replace DS by the name of the dataset):

n = total number of nodes
m = total number of edges
N = number of graphs

(1) 	DS_A.txt (m lines) 
	sparse (block diagonal) adjacency matrix for all graphs,
	each line corresponds to (row, col) resp. (node_id, node_id)

(2) 	DS_graph_indicator.txt (n lines)
	column vector of graph identifiers for all nodes of all graphs,
	the value in the i-th line is the graph_id of the node with node_id i

(3) 	DS_graph_labels.txt (N lines) 
	class labels for all graphs in the dataset,
	the value in the i-th line is the class label of the graph with graph_id i

(4) 	DS_node_labels.txt (n lines)
	column vector of node labels,
	the value in the i-th line corresponds to the node with node_id i

There are OPTIONAL files if the respective information is available:

(5) 	DS_edge_labels.txt (m lines; same size as DS_A_sparse.txt)
	labels for the edges in DS_A_sparse.txt 

(6) 	DS_edge_attributes.txt (m lines; same size as DS_A.txt)
	attributes for the edges in DS_A.txt 

(7) 	DS_node_attributes.txt (n lines) 
	matrix of node attributes,
	the comma seperated values in the i-th line is the attribute vector of the node with node_id i

(8) 	DS_graph_attributes.txt (N lines) 
	regression values for all graphs in the dataset,
	the value in the i-th line is the attribute of the graph with graph_id i
